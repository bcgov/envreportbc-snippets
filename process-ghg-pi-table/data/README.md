## Data Source

The `ghg_pi.R` script, which converts the Provincial GHG Inventory Table into a machine-readable CSV file, expects one file to be in this `data/` directory&mdash;you will need to place the file here manually:

- e.g. `2015_provinicial_inventory.xlsx`

Edit the `ghg_pi.R` script&mdash;`line 21`&mdash;to import using the appropriate file name.
