## Data Source

The `carip.R` script for formatting the CARIP survey output data expects one file to be in this `data/` directory&mdash;you will need to place the file here manually:

- `Current Year CARIP Climate Action Carbon Neutral Progress Survey.xlsx`

This file will (likely) have a year starting the filename in the source directory, but should be copied into the `data/` folder with the above name. Alternatively, you can edit the `carip.R` script&mdash;`line 5`&mdash;to import file with a different file name.
